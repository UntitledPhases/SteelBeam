TO DO
-----
1. Card borders need to reflect collections, maybe just change the color of the current border when adding to a collection
1.5. Filtering based on collection is broken
2. Styling for collection buttons to make them look nicer
3. Images for games in Library (good luck(if you really get defeated by this Ill try to do it sometime this week))
4. Overall UI

Pretty sure if we knock out these 4 things were good to go.

IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!
to make sure your site works properly you probably need to reset your DB, I made changes to the SQL.
    1. Go to phpMyAdmin
    2. Click on Steelbeam
    3. On the top click SQL then paste in the SQL code, it'll drop and remake the tables as needed.

After that you just make a new user, log in, and when you add games to your library they will show up in your library.
Good luck and have fun and wear protection
