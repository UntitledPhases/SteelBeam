TO DO
-----
1. Card borders need to reflect collections, maybe just change the color of the current border when adding to a collection
1.5. Filtering based on collection is broken
2. Styling for collection buttons to make them look nicer
3. Images for games in Library (good luck(if you really get defeated by this Ill try to do it sometime this week))
4. Overall UI

Pretty sure if we knock out these 4 things were good to go.
