ok so uhhhhh

1- css for login page

3- add page for adding/removing games from library
4- api for images and genres and shit

idk i think that's all we need tbh

assignment says:
1 Users must register and log in.
2 Include a database to store derived information from the user (saved
recipes, favorite games, favorite teams, etc.)
3 Include a homepage, splash screen, and have at least three different
pages to navigate from the homepage. (You may need more functionalities
based on the core functionality of your website)
4 Functional search bar
5 Use external APIs to extract real world information ( look for APIs for
recipes, information about sports teams, information about games and
platforms) You should NOT have any information manually inputted at
this stage.
6 Add additional functionality and views that were not specified in the original
project
( ex. Show current sales of specific games, create a shopping list of
ingredients for certain recipes, filter teams and show top players) Please
see me before deciding your functionality.
